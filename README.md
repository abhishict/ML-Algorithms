# Machine Learning from Scratch

## Overview

This project implements various machine learning algorithms and techniques from scratch using only Numpy and Scipy. The focus is on image processing and data analysis, including regression models, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and advanced models like Gaussian Mixture Models and Sparse Autoencoders.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between a dependent and one or more independent variables using a linear approach.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicts binary outcomes using a logistic function.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions images into K clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality by decorrelating features.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE)**: Estimations of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Models data using a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
- **Sparse Autoencoder**: Learns efficient representations by imposing sparsity constraints.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Scipy
